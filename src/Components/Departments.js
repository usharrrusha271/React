            <p style={{textAlign: "left"}}>Electrical Engineering is one of the oldest and core branches of engineering. It is an evergreen branch.
                 The course is presently called as “Electrical and Electronics Engineering”. Electrical and Electronics 
                 engineering course was introduced in the institute during the year 2004. The intake of the branch is 45.<br/><br/>
                 The department has well established and the sophisticated laboratories required for conducting experiments as 
                 prescribed by V.T.U syllabus. Staff always put their best efforts to impart the learning requirements of the students.
                  The department is presently headed by Prof .G. H. Ravikumar, who has 21 years of teaching experience.

    <p style={{textAlign: "left"}}>
    The Department of Computer Science and Engineering was started in the year 2002 along with the foundation of SIET, Tumakuru.
     Initially, only Bachelor of Engineering Programme was offered with the intake 60 which presently has been increased to 120. 
     At present apart from B.E., the department also offers Master of Technology and Ph.D. programmes which cover a number of important
      areas of Computer Science and Engineering, e.g. Computer Networks, Data Warehousing and Data Mining, Machine Learning, Image Processing etc.
       We provide our students with a broad undergraduate and graduate curriculum based on the application and theoretical foundations of computer science. 
       Our faculty and students participate in Teaching and research. The combination of these elements makes the department an exciting environment which
        serves us well in our goal of providing excellence in education, research, and discovery.
